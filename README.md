# theMNISTmodel
Used Tensorflow to build a simple digit classifier, and expanding upon the original MNIST dataset and scale it by x2 

I am doing this by including inverted color image replicas of the original dataset to improve general handwritten digit prediction on conventional surfaces/backgrounds (paper, whiteboard ...etc.)
